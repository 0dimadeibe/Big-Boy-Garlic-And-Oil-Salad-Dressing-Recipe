## Tips and Variations

- You can adjust the amount of garlic, horseradish, or Tabasco sauce according to your preference. If you like a more garlicky flavor, you can add more garlic cloves or use garlic powder. If you like a spicier kick, you can increase the amount of horseradish or Tabasco sauce.
- You can also add other herbs or spices to your dressing, such as oregano, parsley, mustard, or paprika.
- If you don't have ketchup, you can substitute it with tomato paste or tomato sauce.
- If you don't have fresh lemon juice, you can use bottled lemon juice or vinegar.
- If you want to make a vegan version of this dressing, you can use vegan mayonnaise, tofu, or cashew cream instead of mayonnaise and eggs. You can also use agave nectar or maple syrup instead of honey.
